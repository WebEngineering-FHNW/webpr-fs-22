Web Programming module, spring semester 2022

All other Markdown files has been written in an application in which I collect all my digital summaries.
To avoid time lose in editing the same file in multiple places, I will continue my summaries in the other 
application and include the file afterwards in here without controlling if the export supports all layout
and format settings. \
Also, if I will make bigger adjustments in a file I will do these in the other Application and probably 
replace the file in here with the edited one.
